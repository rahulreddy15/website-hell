Feeling bad right now.
Feeling anxious.

All throughout the day today. I've been self concious.
One thing that has been bothering me. Is this shirt. I don't know how to feel comfortable in it.

I drank coffee and that made me a bit mor fidgety and anxious.
I was unable to behave like a normalk human being for a while and was looking aroujnd for validation.

Its ok though. I'm pushing through it.
I'm fighting the good fight.

Positive things that happened today.
I got my first paycheck from New Relic. It was a good amount. For maybe the first time in my life I have a feeling that I've earned my money.
Got to interact with a friend and had a good time doing that.

Things I want to avoid doing.

Stop doom scrolling Twitter.
Stop behaving in ways that you are not proud of. i.e stop stalking people on Slack, LinkedIn etc. Its a bit desperate.
Don't expect much from 1 on 1 interactions.

Decent things

Was anxious for a while. Kept thinking about some girl coming and seeing me and whether my looks etc. would impress her.
Stop this. They are just another person. Do you care what your friend thinks.
Play the long game in life always: Cute girl - Smile. If they initiate or its obvious they want to talk to you. Only talk to them then.
Stop thinking about this. The more you think about these interactions. The more nervous and anxious you will actually get.

So take away: Practice your smile.


Things I've been insecure about

My looks: Fuck that I'm a good looking guy and people will like me
My posture: Yeah I have a bd Giraffe posture. But I'm going to work on fixing it.
Don't go on Reddit to validate your feelings of how bad you are. The cutting statements will only make you feel worse. And why would you want that ?
Ok. I have issues but I' going to work on them. These statements about horrible / bad people dont help anyone.
I want to change certain things. Then change those things.

I am a bit upset today because I continue to think about myself. That's ok. 
Getting comfortable thinking about other things will take time.

You are starting on a journey. Be proud of yourself.
