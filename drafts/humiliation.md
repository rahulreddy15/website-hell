I keep on going back into this loop where i say she humiliated me. That too several times.
Lets look at it closely.

How do I take the sting out of it ?

I felt humiliated because I asked someone to do smoething for me.
And the response I got was not what I wanted.
So I felt humiliated ?
If it was a simple request and you get turned down. Would you feel humiliated ? No I would not.
I was asking for something from someone else.
I felt that I could ask them because I had done things for them.
So in a sense, I had a feeling that they owed me something.
Some other things were involved.
I had an almost extreme desire for the other person to do something for me.

So what is the thing that still bothers me ?
Why am I unable to accept that it is over ?
What am I getting out of feeling this terrible ?

I am definitely getting something.
Otherwise why would I be doing it repeatedly ?

I get to feel bad.
I get to feel like a victim.
After all that I have done for her she could not do the most basic things in return.
This belief allows me to feel like a victim and like a good person who was wronged.
As long as I keep reliving this thought. I will never move on.

And thats the goal right ? To move on !

Why do I want to feel like a victim this badly ?
I know why !!!
When I think about the rest of the things in my life, I feel bad.
I don't feel good about my career...
I don't feel good about my body or my looks...
I don't feel good about my family...
I don't feel good about my life...

But instead of taking responsibility for all of those things.
I am instead just sitting and fantasizing about how things would be if things would have gone well with that girl.
Either that or I am feeling really bad about how things actually went with that girl. 
Blaming her for being how she is and trying to make here feel bad in some act of rage / revenge.
sidenote: Even while writing this I started thinking if I read this to Mythri would she think I was smart ?

I seem to want be praised or appreciated for everything little thing that I do.
